0,Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics. Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.
1,"Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze."
2,"The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop. It is also the way through which a user interacts with an application or a website."
3,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). It helps machines process and understand the human language so that they can automatically perform repetitive tasks. Examples include machine translation, summarization, ticket classification, and spell check."
4,"A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways"
5,"Java is the official language for Android mobile app development. In fact, the Android operating system itself is written in Java. Even though Kotlin has recently become an alternative to using Java for Android development, Kotlin still uses the Java Virtual Machine and can interact with Java code"
6,"Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems"
7,"Unified Modeling Language, or UML, is a visual language that helps software developers visualize and construct new systems. It's not a programming language — it's a set of rules specifically for drawing diagrams."
8,"R is an interpreted language; users can access it through a command-line interpreter. If a user types 2+2 at the R command prompt and presses enter, the computer replies with 4 . R supports procedural programming with functions and, for some functions, object-oriented programming with generic functions."
9,"Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately."
10,"Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention."
11,A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized data-keeping system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself.
12,"Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality."
13,"Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is simply a way to assure quality in the software. It is the set of activities which ensure processes, procedures as well as standards are suitable for the project and implemented correctly. "
14,"Computer graphics is a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Although the term often refers to the study of three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing."
15,A program is a list of instructions or program statements composed in such a way as to enable a computer to solve a problem. The problem to be solved is broken down into successively smaller parts.
16,"DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes."
17,"Data mining is the process of analyzing dense volumes of data to find patterns, discover trends, and gain insight into how that data can be used. Data miners can then use those findings to make decisions or predict an outcome."
18,"Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data."
19,"Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it."
20,PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
21,"Statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data, or as a branch of mathematics. Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics"
22,computer organisation is a field which explains about structure and behaviour of digital computers . its main objective is to make us understand the over all computer hardware structure and all its peripheral devices . it tells us how all the units in the system are arranged and interconnected to eachother.
23,"C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory."
24,"C# (pronounced ""See Sharp"") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers"
25,"JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else."
26,"jQuery is a lightweight, ""write less, do more"", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code."
